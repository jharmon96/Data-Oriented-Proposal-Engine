""Machining Center"", refers to a multipurpose numerically controlled machine tool for the complete and automatic machining of parts requiring multiple operations such as milling, drilling, tapping, boring, and reaming, having an integral tool storage device and an integral means for positioning various faces of the work piece.  It must have facilities for automatic interchanging of varied cutting tools between successive operations.  Excluded from this class are multipurpose numerically controlled machine tools, such as Boring-Drilling-Milling Machines, which require the use of an attachment or accessory for tool storage and/or to position the various faces of a work piece.  These types of equipment are classified in other appropriate classes within group 34.  b.  ""Way-Type Machine"", refers to a special machine tool of station type design consisting of individually mounted self-contained machining units and facilities for indexing the work piece to each station in a predetermined sequence.  The machining unit(s) may be disassembled and rearranged to accommodate different work piece configurations.  Machine is capable of performing single or multiple operations on the work piece simultaneously or in sequence to each station."
